-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code added by the author to the pretty printing of an XSchema based on a 
PADS specification file:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: pads/padsc/comp/ckit/src/ast/pp/extensions/pads/pp-ast-xschema-fn.sml

If padsc is called with a '-x' flag, a XSchema is generated and stored
in a .xsd file (see function generateXschema in padsc/main.sml).

Functions added to pp-ast-xschema-fn.sml:

* Auxiliary functions that given a type identifier (tid) and a table with 
  information about type identifiers (tidtab) return information associated 
  with the type identifier:

  structInfo tidtab tid ---> (structure name, [(field type, field name)])
			it returns a pair containing the structure name and 
			a list of pairs (type, name) of each field.

  unionInfo tidtab tid ---> (union name, [(member type, member name)])
			it returns a pair containing the union name and a 
			list of pairs (type, name) of each union member.

  unionPdInfo tidtab tid ---> (upd name, [(pdtype,pdname)], [(utype,uname)])
			it returns a 3-uple containing the union parse 
			descriptor name, a list of pairs (type, name) of each
			parse descriptor field, and a list of pairs (type, 
			name) of each union parse descriptor member.

  enumInfo tidtab tid ---> (enum name, [element name])
			it returns a pair containing the enumeration name and
			a list, of element names (this list is UNUSED by now)
 
  typedefInfo tidtab tid ---> (type name, base type)
			it returns a pair containing the new type name and 
			the base type.


* Auxiliary functions that add strings to the pretty-printing stream (pps):

  ppXMLName pps (Type,Name) ---> [name=Name] [type=Type]
			it adds name and type, if they exists.

  ppXMLHeader str1 str2 pps (Type,Name) ---> str1 [name=Name][type=Type] str2
			it adds the string str1, name and type, and the 
			string str2 in that order. It's useful to be applied
			to each element of a list in ppXMLList.

  ppXMLList pps [field1,..,fieldN] ---> <element field1/>...<element fieldN/>
			given a list of pairs (type, name) adds each field as
			an element.

  ppXMLSequence pps Fields ---> <sequence> Fields </sequence>
			it adds the tags of a "sequence" and creates a list 
			of elements from the Fields.

  ppXMLRestriction pps Base ---> <restriction base=Base />
			it adds a "restriction" with base type Base.

  ppXMLComplex pps (Name,Fields) ---> <complexType [name=Name]> 
				      <sequence> Fields </sequence>
				      </complexType>
			it creates a complex type with name Name and the 
			sequence of elements Fields.

  ppXMLElemList pps (Name, Fields) ---> <element name=Name> 
					<complexType> 
					<sequence> Fields </sequence> 
					</complex> 
					</element>
			it adds an element with name Name and a complex type
			with the sequence of elements Fields.

  ppXMLChoiceFields pps Fields ---> <choice> Fields </choice>
			it adds a choice type with the list of members Fields

  ppXMLChoice pps (Name, Fields) ---> <complexType name=Name> 
				      <choice> Fields </choice> 
				      </complexType>
			it adds a complex type with name Name and a list of 
			choice members form Fields.

  ppTopElemIfPfile pps (ptyInfo,Type) ---> <element name="PFile" type=Type /> 
			If the Pfile modifier is present, then it adds the 
			root element with name "PFile" and type Type.

  
* Functions that given a PADS type specification, use the previous functions
  to obtain the information associated with the type and add the 
  corresponding XSchema types to the pretty-printing stream (pps):

  ppPStruct  ---> in-memory representation and parse descriptor of a Pstruct.

  ppPUnion   ---> in-memory representation, parse descriptor, parse 
		  descriptor of members, and selected (_tag) branch of a 
		  Punion. 

  ppPArray   ---> in-memory representation and parse descriptor of a Parray.

  ppPEnum    ---> simple type "xsd:int" for Penum.

  ppPTypedef ---> simple type with restriction to the base type of a Ptypedef
		  definition.

  ppPKind    ---> checks the PADS specification type and calls the 
		  corresponding function.

NOTE:
 The root element of a Xschema file is created when a PADS type with the 
 'Pfile' modifier is found. But not all the PADS files contain a type with 
 the 'Pfile' modifier, and some of the files can have more than one type with
 such modifier. 
 When using PADS we need to know which element is the root to boot-strap the 
 compilation, then any PADS file that we want to query must have exactly one 
 'Pfile' type.

NOTE 2:
 An XSchema was generated for each of the example files in directory 
 padsc/examples/p/ using this program, the .xsd files were checked using the
 script test_xschema.sh, and all of them passed without error.
